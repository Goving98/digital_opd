The game involves identifying the right test for the patient symptoms and diagnosing the patient based on the test.
The patient reveals symptoms, the senior AI doctor asks the learner what should be the next step in helping the patient. The learner has to answer in free form text. For every patient, the learner has to understand which is the best test to take for their symptoms, and post getting the test results, what’s the next best diagnosis.
